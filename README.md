🎬 Movie Recommendation System (MRS)
📌 Project Overview

The Movie Recommendation System (MRS) is an AI-based application designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.
It uses machine learning and data analysis techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations, improving user engagement and viewing experience.

🧠 How It Works

The system analyzes user input and movie data using recommendation algorithms such as:

Content-Based Filtering – recommends movies similar to those a user likes.

Collaborative Filtering – suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users.

Cosine Similarity / Vectorization for similarity calculation.

Based on these techniques, the system identifies the most relevant movies and ranks them for the user.
